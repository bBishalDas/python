# simple while loop, loops until a value is false.

i= False

while i<=50:
    print(i)
    i+=True
print(i) 


# here the newly initialized variable in the for loop can also act as an iterator.
n=1
total=0

    

# so the for loop, loops for a known number of times:-

for i in range(5):
   print(i)
else:
   print("end")

# another example of the same is:-
l=[2,4,5,6]

for i in l:
   print(i)
else:
   print("done")


# for loop to double the new value recived after the first operation till 64 times.
# for i in range(64):
 
#  total+=n
#  print(f"squar no.{i+1}: {n}")
#  n*=2

# print(f"total: {total}")
